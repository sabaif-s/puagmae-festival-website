              About the Puagmae Festival
            </h2>
            <p className='text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed'>

              Like the Egyptian Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has a year of 13 months. The first 12 months have 30 days each, and the last 13th month has 5 days and 6 days in a leap year. The name of the 13th month is in Ge’ez and is known as PAGUMIENE. This uniquely short but sweet month of PAGUMIENE just started here in Ethiopia and is going to last for the next six days or five days. The 13th month of PAGUMIENE is more like a transition moment, getting all ready for the New Year celebration, and of course, reflecting on the old year and making a resolution for the coming Ethiopian New Year.

                At the heart of the Puagmae Festival is the aspiration to represent collective cultural knowledge in a grassroots way. This approach encourages the free and informed participation of tradition bearers who it is hoped will play a central role in the shape of the festival’s development and overall outcome.

                One of the highlights of the festival is the traditional coffee ceremony, which is an integral part of Ethiopian culture. The ceremony involves roasting coffee beans, grinding them, and brewing the coffee in a special pot called a jebena. This ritual is a symbol of hospitality and community, bringing people together to enjoy the rich flavors and aromas of Ethiopian coffee.
